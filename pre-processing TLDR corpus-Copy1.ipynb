       "\"I take a beta blocker for my heart condition that not only makes me have crazy dreams , they can feel more real than reality . 2 dreams come to mind which were fucked up . The last and most recent was basically unzipping the skin on my barely 1 year old daughter to save the universe under the direction of an alien . I knew it was fucked up , but I honestly believed what the alien was saying so to save the universe I butchered my daughter . Now that was pretty bad and all , but the first really bad dream I had on the beta blocker has stuck with me just as much . In it I was at my parents house with all of us dressed in * gear . I then became aware that I was in a dream and thought to myself wtf ? a lucid dream ? this is awesome . At that point my feet wouldn't move and my parents gradually walked up to me before violently * me . I couldn't do anything to wake up and it felt as real as anything I have ever done while awake and sober . It felt like the dream lasted hours , I woke up in tears and didn't say much for a few days instead opting to get extremely wasted until I got over it . \""

      "No . This is a terrible misquote . It seems like it will work similarly to Arcade games . You buy a disc as an alternative to network installation , you install the game and link it to your GT . Since your console is associated with your GT , anyone on that console can play the game . If you log in from a different console , you can play , but others cannot without you . Once you leave , the users on the other console will be prompted to purchase the game . They won't be prompted to buy your copy out from under you without your consent . That is preposterous . Why would anyone ever assume it would work that way ? Look , we don't know the details of game ownership transfers , but Microsoft has confirmed that it will be fee free . Hopefully it will be painless , but I'm going to assume that there will be some sort of stipulations to avoid abuse game sharing . This could be something like a timer you can't transfer ownership until you've owned a game for two weeks , or a no loopback you can't own the same copy of a game twice . This is the most fair possible way to allow discless play on multiple consoles . I don't see an alternative besides one person buys a game , and 20 of their friends install it and play for free . If Microsoft were extremely smart , they would make linking the copy to your GTconsole an option , not a requirement . If you don't link , you have to use the CD to play . \n",
