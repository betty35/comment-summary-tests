when you leave work it will last even longer (i'm 50/50 on remembering to do this)\", 'Causes cursor to occasionally jump', \"Most of the time it's fine, then the cursor will freeze (as I'm moving the mouse), then a second later the cursor will jump across the screen\", \"The only issue so far is that it's a little too easy to get a middle click pressed when rolling the wheel\", 'This is a perfect mouse and it easily fits in your hand', \"I try to scroll and suddenly I'm chasing the cursor up and down the page before I remember to hit the wheel to stop the unintended motion\", 'The mouse works very well', 'I do appreciate the off switch on the bottom, as well as the quietness of the scroll function', \"And the scroll wheel click is so perfect, on other 'mice' I never used the scroll wheel

'This mouse is so easy to use', 'The mouse has a nice solid feel to it and the scroll wheel and clicking options are accurate, fluid and responsive', 'One important point - the middle button click is smooth on the Amazon mouse', 'Win-7 responded to my &#34;scroll downs&#34; just fine, but when I scrolled UP on the scroll wheel, the active window would react as if I accidentally scrolled DOWN', 'The only problem I have with it is that it sticks when trying to move up or down a page', \"This mouse's pointer speed is much slower at the same control panel setting than the mouse it replaced\", 'Any setting lower than max, and it took multiple swipes of the Amazon mouse to move the cursor across the screen', 'i enjoy the left button, has a very satisfying click', \"obviously i'm not a very busy man if i can opine on how 'clicky' a mouse button should be\", 'The Amazon mouse tracks well, scrolls smoothly and quietly (you can feel the scroll steps), and the mouse buttons function as they should', 'Nice compact and smooth operating mouse', 'Bought this because a mouse is better for some tasks than a touchpad, especially when the click button on said touchpad is broken', 'Very simple

tower(tight squeeze)than it did to set the new mouse up', 'The clickers are not flimsy like other mouses and the scroll wheel scrolls smoothly without jumping around', 'The only thing I miss is not having easy thumb access back/forward buttons on the side', \"I don't find any problems with it being over or under responsive and the scroll wheel moves with tiny clicks but they are completely silent\", 'The aspect which is very cool is the click of the scroller wheel which activates mouse scrolling', 'The scroll wheel is very smooth and quiet', \"This mouse works as it's supposed to\", \"I realize there is a power button on the mouse itself but this isn't an optimal solution for me either - and the option in the Device Properties should work\", 'Mouse makes the pointer jump all over the

easily', 'Connects instantly if turned off and back on', 'It is a convenient mouse, especially for people preferring a mouse over a track pad on laptops', 'The mouse fits perfectly in the hand and the mouse itself is very responsive', 'The mouse worked immediately, without even needing to press the small \\\\\\\\\"connect\\\\\\\\\" button on the bottom', 'That said, the left and right buttons have very different tactile feedback, and unfortunately in this case the left button (which I use 95% of the time) is mushy', 'The right button has a nice clear \\\\\\\\\"click\\\\\\\\\" feeling, but it\\'s hard to tell when I\\'ve clicked the left button', 'Buttons and scroll wheel have a nice tactical feel', 'Buttons provide good click feel without a loud click sound', 'It will be sitting on the

tactile clicks when you use it', 'Every time I move the mouse around, I feel that the lid sticks out a bit and prevents smooth motion of the mouse', 'if you need two cursors on the screen this will do it', \"I can use this mouse on multiple surfaces and haven't had to reset it yet\", 'Everything just feels right, it glides over a mouse pad, the scroll wheel feels great and the button action is perfect', 'Pointer movement is accurate and scroll wheel feel/operation is very good', 'I like the 2 buttons and a scroll wheel design', '3)  The scroll wheel has the perfect resistance for me',
