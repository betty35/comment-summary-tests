Had this for almost three months and it started to act up
 There was no visual signs of any broken issues
Stops working after a couple of months
  I will post an update if anything goes wrong, which is why I gave it 4 stars
 I tried 2 other brands and returned them
 It has even resisted some wear from my cat chewing on it
 One fell apart right when opened
 Less than a month after purchase, two of four have stopped working
 They were not under heavy stress, just sitting on my bedside table and in my office
), and then eventually they didn't work at all
Lasted about 4 months before all of them stopped working
it doesn't cause that annoying &#34;not compatible&#34; pop up either
Stopped working after 6 months
  crappy product or defect idk
There's no sign of the ends clumping together like how the apple ones always does after a few months
Surprised they lasted this long! (2 months)
 Only been using for a month though
Had for a couple months, not worn or broken
 Our factory ones were no longer working
Broke after owning it for a month
 The black one did not work right out of the package
After 10 months use
 The page you are viewing bounces all over the place, top then scrolls down to bottom
 Exits out of pages and is very irritating
 Only work 1 way, fall apart after a couple of weeks
 I bought 4 and none of them worked for longer than a month
 It's been close to a month and one of them has stopped working
but it just stopped working
 I thought I lost the wire within a week of purchasing
 Turns out, it was left in a pair of scrubs
 It went through wash & dry
As described, worked w/out error msg & charges quickly!
I bought 4 and they all still work months later
These BOTH stopped working within a week
After a little over 6 months it started to split and fray
 After a week stopped working completely
 One of them doesn't work
 Really frustrated with this product especially since this was a birthday gift
 No non OEM warnings either
 These ones just lasted longer before it failed
 Probably my fault but this is not durable
 I'm not getting the error messages I was getting
Stopped working after 12-15 uses
 If they stop working I'll try to come back and do an update, but I'm making no promises ;)
 All 4 stopped working within a couple weeks after purchase
  No &#34;Compatibility&#34; messages :-)
 Never had &#34; accessory not supported&#34; error message
one came and didn't work the other one's neck broke to the point of where i pugged it in i didn't notice it ripped and accidentally bent it and smoke came out
 It popped completely out of the sheath
  That's not the fault of the company, though, rather mine
I used it about a week on an out of town trip and the tip fell off
Lasted 9 months without issues, then suddenly out of the blue, no longer compatible
It was great until it just suddenly stopped working - it only lasted 3 months, I'm not sure if this is the norm nowadays, but my previous one lasted a year and a half with heavy use
Lasted for a few weeks and then stopped working
 question the longevity of it
 I have seen this for a lot of users
They were broke and did not work
works at home and in the car
 I've had it for several months now and there are no signs of wear
Had it for 2 months now
  Sometimes it loses connection but 99% of the time it works right!
 Still working after 2 months
  No signs of wear and tear as I see on all other chords I have owned in the past
  Had for months and still work like the first day
They stopped working after a month
 I didn't try to replace it as it wasn't worth my time
 Still working 3 months later!
  I never received the second set at all
 I tried it on a different power source and it did the same thing
 No error messages about incompatibility
Like a lucky fling on a business trip, it lasted for a couple days then died just as quickly
Lasted less than 2 months
 It also took over a month to get
 Waited over a month of them to come and one of them doesn't work
Edit: A couple of months later and I purchased another 2
 The fact that it became unusable after such short period of time means the product is not reliable (quality is not guaranteed
  No error messages like the ones you get with copycats
stopped working after few months
 As expected one lasted about two weeks
 After that,  they would work sometimes
 I was very disappointed after it worked for only a couple days
I bought two of these and both only worked once
 Fortunately I was able to carefully remove it but beware of the low quality of this product
Broke after 2 days
5 Stars? Two pack and only one worked
 The first stopped working within a week
 The second stopped working about 3 weeks later
 This gave her about a month or 2 of use then fell apart
One failed after a week
It simply didn't work
This one did not dissapoint and almost started a fire after it shorted out internally
Product does not work
One week  of light use - it's broken
  (the metal tab broke off from the plastic housing)
 Gave one to a friend (status unknown), and the other one just died
 Not sure what was up with that? It hasn't happened since, though
These didn't last more than a month
 II had to throw it in the trash
 Mine crapped out after a month ( to be honest I'm not sure it ever worked but I noticed it after the month return period)
  We've had them for a few months now and they are still working fine, no error messages
  I have tried those $0
 They have been working 2-3 months ago since I received them so far
  I was concerned about non computability issues that I had been warned about
