Works like a charm!
Good but not for heavey dotey
 Just take care of your things and they'll take care of you too
 I would highly recommend
 Would get them again
Work as good as Apple
Perfect! Exactly what I needed
I highly recommend it
 Just gonna stick with them from now on :)
Seems to work well
 But 2 out of 4 dying isn't awesome
Yea ! These are good 
Well nothing bad to say about this everything is better when what I was expecting
 Your results may vary but I'm disappointed
  These ones from iXCC are my gotos
Item was as described
I have waited a while to write this
 They do exactly what I want them to do
 This works just as well
 It was cuter, but this one actually charges, so that helps
What I wanted in two colors!
These are much better
 Looks just like the picture
 The whole experience is rather akin to preparing astronaut food
 I'd give them 4
Wonderful replacement for the real thing
 3' is shorter than you think
very nice! wish it was a little longer but eh it works
 They do what they're supposed to
 They do what it's supposed to do
 Don't work most of the time
 We'll see how the other one does, but it's not looking to promising
If I could give no star I would
 Don't waste your time
Just great quality as expected
Came promptly and as shown in the pictures
Did exactly as advertised
 iXCC is definitely MFi
 Hope it will last
Works just like it should :-)
 Fits in all my various cases
  We have reordered several more
I honestly wish I can give this zero stars
What else can I say but &#34;It works!&#34;
 the &#34;certified Apple&#34; is quick talk
  At the end the end of the &#34;Disclosure&#34; it says loud and clear
So Far So Good!
Exactly as pic shows
 I don't have any complaints yet
 Feel like the real thing
So Far So Good
 We will see if that is true after a few more months
Does exactly as expected
 I wouldnt recomend at all
Works as I would expect
they seem to work as expected
They work, so that's cool
seems to be what I wanted so far
 It worked just for one day
 Never an issue with a &#34;unverified blah blah blah&#34;
  Completly useless, had to through it away
 That seems more reasonable than 3 months
 Never a problem with either
  That's what's most important
  what more can you say?
 Highly recommend it and will get another of longer length
These get the job done
product worked as mention
 And the price was right
 I was not disappointed
Works the way we'd expect it to
What more do you want
 Even survived a bit of puppy chewing
Everyone who nags for a regiew gets a bad one
iXCC folks if you read this, please reach out to me to make this right
2 out of 3 worked out of the box
The other 2 work like a charm
Good all around construction
  The choice is yours
sometimes not work very well
 I was hoping it would last longer
I will need more soon
 I guess its what you pay for 
Two pack was nice
 Not very happy at the moment
These work as intended
 sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't
  Data and power flow in - what more can you ask for
putting them everywhere!  Rock solid!
 So be aware and plan ahead
 The other is still doing great!
ProsDurabilityCheaper than apple's cablesWork greatConsNone
  We never had to search we know where they are
 Needless to say I love it!
  It had been that way all night apparently
  I slept fine last night
  Slightly poorer, but better rested
Finally a Calle that works
I cannot recommend this to anyone
I do not recommend this for anyone
Exactly what I asked for
 Overall I am pleased
 spend me whole day to take it out=[
PERFECT for that we needed it for
 Got 5 of them
I like to take chances :p)
 Hope now is that no damage has been done
 Boy was I wrong, we'll see how long that one lasts
7 mm x 5
4 mm x 6
Better than I had expected
So far it seems to be working as expected
It works as described
Good while it lasts - unfortunately this is only about two months
  This was finally worked great
excellent! these work fabulously
 I'm at a loss
 If we do they stop with in a couple of weeks
Works as described, perfectly
Have never received the &#34;can't charge&#34; warning
 It's strange how one feature works but another doesn't
 I have to say I am really satisfied with it
0 A Male to Micro B (3 Feet / 0
 Just a heads up
Yup, these really do work
