I've ordered a ton of these white and black, long and short
 Lasted longer than the ones I got from Apple
  This is very durable and has zero connectivity issues
I have ordered these twice now ( because my kids keep losing them !) and they hold up better than any others and charge the phone quickly
I have used several of these and love them
  Not with these!  Works!  Great value to buy in pairs
 Both get used daily and I've had them for over a year at this point
Perfect!  Better construction than original and charges fast
 (Had them about 2 weeks & no problems)
 This is the second time I am buying, and first one served me well over a year
 I've had for over a month now and unlike the one star reviews, mine has not spontaneously combusted, fallen apart, or stopped working
I have several sets
 I keep one at home and keep the other with me throughout the day
  Any others are inferior to the MFI certified ones
This is my second pair of iXCC now
Not so great, they work, but they spark and shock you 
 they're a fire hazard
 High quality and durable
I've bought these for my household and for my mom
Great and they don't break
 I keep one in my car and one in my purse
 I felt the difference in the quality in comparison to the leading brand, it feels a lot more stronger, more reliable
 These seem more durable and sturdy than others I have tried
Had them for a while and still kicking
Not durable, I bought two
 I bought the 3ft black and white ones and had them for months; no problems
I recently bought one more because my dog chewed it up
I keep one in my car and one in my room (:
  Now, hopefully they will be durable
it works with otter defender case
 Easy to use, no worries about clipping and un clipping, just put it there , easy, take it so easy
Got these as a replacement for the one that came with my wife's phone and so she would have one for the car and two in the house
  These are solid, they work, they fit even in tight charging ports, it's all good
 I've had some for a year and none have failed even a little bit (vs other cheaper ones that never work or die quickly)
 Already purchased a second set for more usage
 Like the ones from amazon
 So far, they're working well, and at least as long as any others we've bought (including Apple brand)
 Yes, they'll wear out, but no sooner than any kind I've ever gotten
 Had zero issues getting a replacement once the first one broke
Great deal! Functional and well worth buying the two-pack! I now have one for my home and car
 Each cord (in the 2-pack) comes sealed in a little plastic/foil pouch, and the two pouches are enclosed in a resealable bag
Pleased with charger it is the second one I ordered
 The connecters are just as small and they are recognized as MFi
 Not as durable feeling as the ones from Apple so I'm being a bit careful with them
 Had a pair for over 6 months this is my second order
No issues, I use these as my work/travel chargers
Inexpensive, fast delivery, and they get the job done! I really like that it comes in black because it looks more discreet in the car
 Looks strong and i love the fact that it comes with two so i can keep one at hone and carry a 2nd on the go
After using these for a few weeks we are happy with them
 Still works great! Can't beat that, include a 1 year warranty? Well worth the money
 The one year warranty is worth it in itself
 they have a small profile so they fit well into our iPhones with case issues
Great product - didn't realize how long they really were (my fault) but great quality and value
 They appear to be good quality, at least as good as the OEM
  I go through a lot of these, and I have tried the Apple brand, Amazon, and cheap ones, they all wear down
 Lasted longer than the apple ones so I'm very pleased
These are good for the price, but one broke after the first week of using it
  They work perfectly!  No problems whatsoever and they appear to be made very well!  I highly recommend!
 Bought a set last year and they work great
Works great, used them in with the car adaptor and got a speedy charge! I've had ones that didn't : (
 I use one in my room and the other in my car and I have not had any problems
Had them for a couple weeks and so far so good
Good quality and works with my iPhone (for now),  I'll see how long they last
 I might order another one to use at home
  The molding at each end is precise and tight
  I bought these, and am very satisfied; the quality is good, the materials are good, and so far, they're holding up perfect
Will probably order more - so I have one for each car, one for work, one for home, etc
  I purchased them about 5 months ago and have not had any problems with them so far
 I bought them cause of the reviews and price
 They also fit my lifeproof case for IPHONE 6
 Why the heck is it so hard to get one that works for more than a month (if at all)?!?!?!?So we have been using these for a few weeks and they are great, they work perfectly
 As for how long they work I have no idea
Only had this set a few weeks, but seem sturdier than other brands I have tried
 Also comes with a 12 month warranty i was not aware of, which is good because it seems like the replacement ones I've bought in the past wear out far sooner than that
 I like the black one for my car
 So impressed with them, I purchased a pair for my sister
I love this buy!  They work as desired and have great quality as well
  I like the secure feeling ends; seems like they will last and not pull out from the plugs
 Time will tell if it'll fall apart like previous products purchased from other companies
 I use one in my can and the other in the office
Works the same as the oem for less than half the price
 These seem sturdy made and after a month of using they still haven't twisted or broke open yet
These were an okay price and with buying a car charger for each of our cars, I bought 2 of these two packs, one for each car
  I thought I bought them long enough to reach to the backseat, but I guess not
  Don't know how long they will last, but they are not that expensive and I don't think any of them last all that long
  I keep and use one in the car and the other on my desk
 I have bought this brand in the past and they just don't last
They work great! Awesome price for 2 IPhone chargers, they seem pretty sturdy and they came in nice packaging
These are perfect for my kids that don't take care of anything
 They can be very durable if we'll taken care of
 Do not buy because they are not very durable
 Bought one for my home and office
Works great with the Life proof box but only the 3 ft version
 The first pair I bought for myself and have had for quite some time (maybe a yr or so)
 I use one in my car and one at work, so they get used often
 The other pairs I've bought for my kids(10,11,15)
 They hold up pretty well for the kids, but not totally kid proof lol
 When not abused, they have lasted me a yr or so and still working
I ordered 4 of these over the last 6 months and all are working and in good shape
  I bought two of these for my iPhone 5s a few months ago and they have performed very well and are still going strong
 I'm mostly impressed with the durability and build quality
 I ended up ordering a couple more for the cars, work, and around the house
I have several of these both in 3 foot size and in 10 foot size
 I bought some from an eBay seller for a cheaper price and they stopped working after the first week
  Not sure why the black one is significantly thinner and a different material than the white one though
 They work great with my 5s! I've since ordered 2 more and those work just as perfectly as the first ones
  They fit my iPhone 6+ well
 They work every bit as well as the original one does but at a very attractive cost
  After months of heavy use, they still fit securely and charge quickly
 So far they hold up OK (after almost a year now)
  No issues at all with fitting in cases
Great product!  I've bought so many &#34;Apple Certified&#34; chargers and they either never work at all, or die within a few days
  They're great!  They work in the car and at home and are a nice long length, so they offer you some freedom while your phone is charging
 I ended up purchasing four or five to use around the house and in my vehicles
 They are well made, strong and good looking
 We use them daily and they still work great
 They appear to be good quality, I like the mfi certification
These work great, last longer than OEM and no errors!
Great product - works perfectly, fits with my case easily
 Buy the Anker! No problem with them after several months now
  This replacement has proved to be more durable and reliable
 These are great, and I really like the different size dimensions it comes in
These work just as well as the original but much less expensive
  They are well constructed, are of very good quality, and have held up well
 Each of those times I've ordered these chargers and have yet to be disappointed
 I've even recommended them to my mom who seems to have the same problem with keeping up with chargers
works great after 3 months unlike other cheaper brands
  Most of all, it's certified and simply works: no warnings/sporadic failures/heat issues that come with the cheaper knock-offs
Love them, you can never have enough chargers
The product has been extremely durable
  No overall complaints, and they fit with a lifeproof case
  I have found that, even if you buy the &#34;brand&#34; name ones, they start to give out after several months of use
  Really though, don't get the cheap ones from the ebay or random places on the Internet
 Nice quality and every IXCC Product comes with 12 months warranty
 They appear to be made of quality materials and very much worth the price
 I keep one at work and one in my car
 They are sturdier quality for sure
 These work well, are a good length, and are of a good quality
I purchased these 3 months ago and they are still working perfectly
 I have several of the Amazon Basics (which are great also) but liked that these were less expensive
Been using these for a few months now, and I find them holding up well to use
Great chargers, and a great price too!
I have been using two of these for over a month now
 Price is inexensive, and quality is better then OEM
 The ends do not fall off like other brands
They work like champs, no problems at all
 I've had them for 4 months now and they still work great and look great
 Been using them for months, one in my car and one in my bedroom, no problems and no wear
Used them for about a month with my 5C
 Really durable and work as expected
 They seem to be sturdier than the the stock apple ones
I've owned these for a few months and the work fine and the price was very good
 I do not recommend them
 not because my original set broke, but because (well one of them kind of broke--my cat chewed through it) they're good chargers
THEY ARE SLIM ENOUGH TO FIT AN IPHONE 6 LIFEPROOF NUUD CASE! I had hoped the 6ft would also fit, but the male lightning portion is significantly larger than these, so I'll just be using these all the time!
 I'll probably buy them again since I always lose mine
Work great and cost less than OEM
  I've had countless cheap knock offs, but these are very sturdy and have no compatibility issues on any devices I've tried
 I have a bought a total of two more pairs (a total of SIX!) for my cars, computers, and beside plugs
Good product only drawback is the lightning head is a little bigger than will fit in most cases
 They are a little rigid making them feel delicate but that is not a deal killer
 Use them in the house and in the cars
 It's nice to have a spare at work and in the car and not break the bank with it
 I specifically bought this one because it showed the narrower style
Had this for about a month and it's durable and faultless so far
 Now if they last and dont have an issues, then I would venture to say that these are just as good as Apples
Love them!  Daughter hasn't had any problem with either one
  Keep one in the car and one in her room!
  Cant comment on durability yet
EDIT: I bought these in March
They work great and I saved money buying two
 They're great and I hope they will continue to work for many months
  I plan to purchase another one but longer
  They seem to be made out of solid material
 Not seeing any distinct overheating but I won't be taking any chances and only use these when I'm at home or around them
  They are used every day and have no broken or have had any other problems so far
 Ive had no issues whatsoever and the quality and durability seem great after a couple months of using them
 Sometimes you're lucky and they last a bit longer, but on the whole, they aren't worth it
 Good price, solid performance, and have held up for months
  I would recommend them
 They work great with my Lifeproof case
 I haven't used these extensively, as I purchased them specifically to keep in my cars in case I need to charge on the go
 These are sturdy, works fine and MFI compliant (i
 They feel quality, and best of all, they work as they should
 I have no issues with them whatsoever and will be buying more when needed
About an inch shorter than OEM, but otherwise good quality
they are sturdy and also working without any problem
  As these are MFI certified, you should be safe that these will continue work
  I already bought a second pair
