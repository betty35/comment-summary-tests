Good product and good seller
Great product fast shipping!!
Order was quick and came as expected
 This is second time purchasing from this company
So far so good! Fast shipping & good product
Also, the company's customer service is outstanding, having contacted me with a one year warranty and offering assistance if the product were to fail
Received two of these
My items got here in a timely fashion
 Use them all time on different devices  I have several and have never got &#34;device not recognized &#34; arrived quickly with free shipping
  Thank you very much and I hope I'll be able to deal with the same buyer in the future
Good quality, no error messages n would buy again
Package arrived on time
  Product was just as described and arrived in a sealed bag
Great Quality!Loved it as soon as I opened the packaged
 I have ordered them twice
 This time I ordered them in a two pack so I have an extra one
 The seller also stands by their warranty because I had an issue and it was resolved quickly
 Arrived fast and love that there are 2 chords in this set
Fast shipping and works as intended
 Everytime I order from iXCC!!
bought the 2 pack and paid extra for 1 day shipping since I was leaving for vacation
  They arrived in 2 days, packaged well
  i had to send back Amazon Basics because it didnt work with the defender
 Plus, they have a 18 months guarantee
Product arrived quickly and was just like the advertisement showed
Ordered on May 12th and has stopped working in just over a month
Fast shipping and works perfectly!
 That was a nightmare from customer service to shipping time, to quality to feedback concerns to them just quitting working
 I decided to give it a try instead of hassling with returning and re-ordering
Received what I ordered and it works as intended
 Arrived promptly and were exactly as described
Quick shipping and great quality!
 I've ordered 2 times and need to order at least 1 more
arrived faster than expected
 Waiting to see if they also refund the return shipping fee
 Shipping was fast & packaging done well
Good quality, prompt service, fair price
Package came on time- everything arrived as outlined in listing
 Seller sent the product quickly
Excellent Service and Product!
 Which makes me an unhappy customer and giving it an overall rating of 2 stars
  This has a 12 month guarantee, so we shall see :)
 They do have a limited warranty for 1 year but you have to send it to them in Redmond WA
I received item not even a month and it is broken I bought two of them and the other one is already falling apart I would need to but new ones soon , they offer 1 year warranty but I cant find a way to contact them dont buy this item its cheap
 On top of that I needed an arm and a leg just to contact the seller
Arrived on time and works great! No complaints!
This item works great and the shipment and delivery was quick
 Thanks! And a year warranty
  I doubt these were actually MFI certified as they claimed to be
  They even changed their warranty from lifetime to 3 months after I purchased them and changed the manufacturer name from iXCC to Omaker so people would not know
works exactly as it should, would order again and most likely will order again
Great price fast shipping compatable w Apple products
 Read the photo I provided of the package
  Did have a problem with prior order where I got non iXCC branded chargers but could have been Amazons fault not theirs as Amazon ships their products for them
  One of the older chargers I have from them finally started messing up so now I get to see the exchange / warranty process but I have had it for a few months so for the price I am more than happy with the quality
Received OK and look to be of good quality
Great product and great seller!
 Quick delivery through Prime
Product arrived quickly and was as described
  So far, one to two months after ordering, all works well
  ixcc contacted me after my previous review and quickly replaced the cable
 The one year warranty was the icing on the cake
Received on time and in good condition
  I have received one on warranty, and now waiting for a second one from warranty replacement
 still waiting on it, been over 3 weeks that I sent it out for replacement
Received warranty replacement yesterday after contacting seller thru Amazon
  Very helpful customer service
  MFI Certified is definitely the way to go
 Items are past return deadline also
Great packaging & delivery & works perfect as additional units for my iphone 5s
  No way to contact seller other than leave neg feed back
  How do you claim the 1 year warrenty?
 I returned it to the company and was surprised how quickly the replacment arrived
Product was received quickly
  Received on time, definitely recommend!
Excellent product, fast shipping - would recommend and buy again
Quality product and very fast delivery
 Overall, very happy and would (and likely will) buy again!
great cable, fast shipping
Wanted to have some extra charges for the car, truck, boat, etc
Item works great and arrived in timely manner
 great price, great shipping
It's great to deal with a vendor that produces a product that works the way it should, that delivers promptly, and that offers products at a lower price
Works well and shipped quickly
 When my cable stopped working, I emailed them and within 24 hours I had a response with mailing label to return the defective cable
 One of the best cables I've ever bought, great warranty, and awesome customer service! A+ thanks again!!

 Bought additional ones from XCC
I had purchased the twin pack from IXCC here on amazon to make sure I did not get a fake one like it states in the description
 If you buy this or any other product and find it satisfactory you should contact the manufacturer or merchant and exchange it
 Very displeased that I waited over a month for a defective product
Product is made in China and ship from China so it will take a while (but within the promised delivery date)
 It took exactly 33 days  to deliver after my order had been placed
Bought the single only package and most recently the double cable package
Great deal, works as advertised
  great customer experience too
 Amazon gets 5 starts for their return processing
 Amazon refunded have the price, but I wanted two that's why I bought this
 Fast shipping, great product
 Customer service responded promptly and resend me the new cables (APO address, free of charge)
4 Stars for cable quality and 5 stars for the iXCC Customer service
Great product, great vendor
  Now i have to go through the motions to return an inexpensive item
  I contacted IXCC and have not yet heard a response
  I tried to return thru amazon, but I was not allowed even though the IXCC have a 1 year warrenty
 Definitely looking into how to contact the vendor
  I sent it in an envelope to their address with a copy of the Amazon invoice, and within 3 days I received an email back confirming receipt of the defective item and a replacement being shipped to me
  Great customer service just earned them another star (upgraded from 3 to 4 stars)
The cables arrived a day late via Amazon Prime
Both worked, verified and all
works great and was delivered quickly
  Unfortunately, I missed the return window on Amazon
 Charges fast, came nicely packaged and all
Great price, received them fast
 So far they have charged great
 The white is a 3 ft while the black is a 6 ft
 I have yet to hear from them regarding my refund however
 Shipping was also fast!
Work perfect, charge and dates tramsmission
  Appears to be of good quality and see no signs of early issues
