 No tears to the cable, like you often have with apple headphones or other chargers, plus the wire is still neat and clean hasn't really accumulated any dirt or smudges (I bought the white one so that says a lot)
 Whether you're looking for a primary iphone charger or a secondary charging cable for your car or for traveling, this product gets the job done!Overall, a great item at a great price (no need to overpay at the Apple store)
awesome product, not a thin flimsy cable like the OEM part from Apple
 Cables are great quality and charge my apple devices greatly
They work as expected! Much better than any of the other cables for the iPhone I have bought on Amazon
Great cord! Fits a Lifeproof case perfectly(at least the 3 ft does!) Would be happy to buy again
 Best I've come across - equal or better than Apple's own charger
 These are the best non-Apple chargers I've purchased
It is a perfect replacement for your Apple charging cord
Apple certified cables are the BEST
  Don't buy unless it says Apple MFI certified
These work great much cheaper than Apple
 It looks identical to the original Apple Lightning Cable (except for the iXCC badge), but I can tell from the way I use it, it has better quality
Excellent product that has proved highly reliable and equal to Apple product quality
 Bought them to replace the original Apple cords which never seems to last very long
 One cord works only for the iPhone and the other only works for the iPhone
The plastic &#34;skin&#34; on the outside is a lot better than the standard ones from apple
 These are literally the worst chargers
These lightening cables fit perfectly in my Apple iPad and Apple #6 iPhone
Of all the chargers on Amazon that claim to be Apple Certified, this is one of the few that actually is
 This, on the other hand, is comparable to an Apple brand USB cord and works excellent for charging quickly
 I bought a black and white together for the price of one Apple brand cord
  In my opinion built pretty sturdy, so far no annoying 'this cable is not recognized by Apple' so it won't charge your Apple device
  The lightning connector that plugs into the Apple device is slim enough to fit without problems with the cases we have (New Trent Alixio - Transparent and Roocase KAPSUL)
So far these work just as well as the manufactured cables that you can purchase from Apple
So far these cords have been the best longest lasting iPhone aftermarket cords I have purchased and before these I have purchased quite a few I will be buying again if these ever fail
I use this cable every day and it works well to charge my Iphone 6 plus
 I don't have any issues with compatibility like some of the other non-apple cords
 No need to buy over priced apple ones
works as well as the Apple branded one
Have a iPhone 4s and purchased two of these one for charging and one for connecting to the iMAC
 Cord isn't as soft and flexible as official Apple cord, but for a much cheaper price, that's a small gripe
 Lightning connector end is same size as Apple's so it fits most, or all, cases
 This replace is great and has been effectively charging the iPad
 Very high quality, and they stick nicely to the apple form factor which helps with a lot of phone cases that don't take into account larger replace cables
I have a lifeproof case, and these are one of the non-OEM cables that still work with the Lifeproof case
 They claim to be apple certified but its just another s*ty knock off in packaging to make you think its certified
Nice cables work with iPhone 6 and iPad
 It works just as well as the Apple brand cords -- and fits in a Lifeproof case we now have
  Many of my non-Apple cables don't work well with the computer or the car USB port but these do fine
Oem functionality at a reasonable price point, how it should be!
Apple should start shipping these cables with their products
 Dont tear like the original Apple cables do
 Its been a few months now, and I have no problem with these cables for my Iphone5 and my son has a 5c and its also working well
 Works just as well as the actual Apple wires
I bought four of these and they all failed within a few months, just like every other non-apple lightning cable I have tried
These cables work perfectly- no error message- with my 5th generation iPod touch (running iOS 8)
 your best bet for a new cord if you need one is to get belkin or apple
 The 3 foot cables are nearly identical to the cables from Apple
This is the best iPhone cord I have found! Even better than the original Apple cord when you get your iPhone! Highly recommended!
These work perfectly with Apple products
I got these cables a while ago as a lower cost alternative to the official Apple cables
  These cables are well made and work just fine with the iPhone and iPads for both charging and data
  Not like some less expensive cords, these have worked as well as Apple originals for us and for a much, much better price
Great quality and price for Apple certified product
I purchased 4 of these because we keep losing them and 2 out of the 4 have problems connecting with the ipad mini's
  Other than appearance, I can't tell a difference between these and apple's cables
 I find it very hard to believe Apple certified these
These are Apple Certified! DO NOT BUY CORDS FOR YOUR APPLE PRODUCTS IF THEY ARE NOT CERTIFIED
Half the price of Apple and work just as well
I've had two Apple MFI Certified iXCC 3-foot cables for a few weeks and they are working well
Best Apple certified lightning cable
99 thinking why not 2 chargers better price
This is the best non-Apple branded cable available
[Apple MFI Certified] iXCC Â® Lightning Cable 3ftAt first i thought they were great but after 6 months they stop working
 They seem to work just as nicely as the ones apple sell
 No need to go pay 3x-4x to buy the same cable from Apple
as fast as an apple cable, half the price
Like all other cables i've bought, including the one that came with my iPhone, it will go bad
I bought 2 of these cables for an iphone 5s, and iphone 5
Works great, very durable compared to original iphone cable
Cable broke after a few months but this is about the same quality as Apple's
I can't believe they work and only at 1/2 price of an original apple cable
 You will better off spending a few more bucks and buying the original Apple product
These cables work perfect for my iphone 6 and my daughters iphone 5
 It says the &#34; certified by the developer&#34; NOT APPLE so that means whatever they  make is certified by them
 &#34;please note the use of this excess three with iPod iPhone or iPad may affect wireless performance&#34;
I love Apple products
 I hate Apple charging cords
I was tired of dragging my one apple cable everywhere so I bought this
SIDE NOTE: LIKE THIS IF YOU WANT APPLE THE CHANGE THEIR CHARGERS
 I Love apple, but I soon be switching if these new chargers continue to fail so quickly, but until then, these seem to be a good quality cable
Good price, fit my case (which most non Apple chargers doesnt) and no problems in a month of using it daily
 I blame Apple mostly for this, but the cable seems to work fine
I was worried buying non-apple cables, but these have proven to be just as good
So far much better than the crappy ones made by apple that only last like a week of light usage
Both cables work great for my iPhone 6
The product looks to be holding up better than the product from apple
 I would still not want to pay as much, but oh common, its Apple so America will blindly pay
Good cables, I tired the cheap ones and within a months all 3 that I bought were not working, get the apple MFI certified cables
It is so hard to find a quality cable that syncs, charge, and fits the iPhone in the lifeproof case but I can say that this DOES DO THAT!All is well and been using for over two weeks now
  Would probably purchase cords with a warranty next time like the Apple one's since they can be swapped out within the first year if they go bad
This product is very cheap and altho is apple certified its junk
Great alternative to Apple cables and they have longer cables that work great too
This is basically the same cable apple provides except it is cheaper
 This cable will fit on any case that the apple cable does
This cable DOES NOT fit the iPhone 6 life proof case
I purchased these to replace the forever shredding Apple cords that always only seem to last a short period of time
Reasonably priced and I hope these cables hold out, as they said they are Apple MF
The cable both charge and sync both  my iPad mini and my iPhone 6 so for the price these cables are excellent
I have not had any problems where iPhone says &#34;not compatible&#34; which I have had with cheaper cables - just plug it in and it works - never had an problem
Finally a cable that works perfectly on my spple devices without the cost of apple!
 Great value and they last longer than the original cords that came with the IPhone ( those only lasted 2 months for me and my husband)
 Not quite as durable as an apple cord
 This is solidly built without being any bigger than the Apple original
These cable worked (and continue to work) perfectly with my iPhone and mini ipad, unlike others that I purchased from others vendors for less and which were eventually rejected for iPhone use
These cables (lightning) are far superior to most all other cables on the market and even Apple's own
  If not for the logo, I'd think this was the same cable provided by Apple
These cables are awesome, they work great with iPhone 5s and 6, no issues
 They are Apple MFI Certified
 The casing is a bit stiffer and likely better than the Apple cables
 The longer cables have a thicker end that just barely fits into the opening on my Zagg folio, the shorter cables are almost identical size to the Apple cables
I did not get the uncertified cable notice for these cables and they work as well as Apples for a lot less money
works great and cheaper than the Apple cables
 They are a little more stiff then the apple cables but it makes them feel a little more sturdy
The cable works for my Apple devices and is durable - I used them all over the places and pull/plug them all the time
 They appear to be solidly made and at this point I expect that they will continue to work for us until Apple decides to again change specs
 Perfect replacement for when your apple one wears out
  Much cheaper than official Apple cords and work perfectly
 I like that the molding around the connector is as small as Apple's, so that these cables are able to fit my wife's lifeproof case without any issues
 I was looking for anything else but actually buying apples expensive cords
Great price and identical in functionality to official Apple cables
I found this to be more durable than Apple's cables
Apple's cables have a tendency to peel off near the edges
These work just as good as the apple ones for half the price! Will buy again! Works with my iPhone 6, 5s, 5 and iPad mini
  It is very slightly shorter than the Apple cables, but it's not even noticeable
These are working perfect with iTunes and Power charging
 Two cables for less than the price of an Apple brand cable
The quality is even better than the genuine cable that comes with iPhone
DO NOT BUY THESE CABLES FOR iPhone 6
This cable works just as good as apple's lightning cable with my iPhone 6
Terrific cables! The quality of construction is much better than a cable from Apple snd these cost less
 Works just like the official apple cable
 So far I haven't have any issue with the cable twisting like the official apple cable
These are my go-to lightning cables for when I need some and do not want to pay the full price Apple sells them for
Cords work just like original Apple product
 These cables look like they will last longer than the last Apple cable I purchased
A cheaper alternative to get additional lightning cables without buying from Apple or genuine cable
Cables work perfectly with my IPhone 6
Having purchased various non-Apple certified cables for my Apple products over the years, I've always been let down
 When the cable for my wife's iPad began to fray, I came to Amazon to look for a replacement
 It was also reassuring to see they are Apple MFI Certified
 I'm very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend these cables to those who know it's worth it to pay a little more to have a good, quality cable but still don't want to pay the sky-high prices for an Apple branded cable
  Seriously, if you pay $10 for something and it breaks after a year, feel lucky and go buy that same brand!  My charger that came with the phone (from the fruit company:-) didn't last that long
I bought a used iPhone 5 and it did not include any cables, which I was in need of
 At the time I purchased this cables, getting two(2) 3ft cables was slightly more than getting a single cable - either 3rd party or official(and still being Apple Certified)
 They work with the Apple charger as well as other brands
I not tell any difference btw this one and the ones I bought directly from Apple (except the lower price)
  I fully expect these cords will outlast the one supplied by Apple with the iPhone
Works great at far less $$ than an apple product
The cable works well with an iPhone, and seems to be of decent build quality
(to date) no issues with these cords; typically when purchasing off-brand cords for iphone, they get worn & suddenly you start receiving an error msg on your phone stating that this cable is not compatible for the product - not the case here! extremeely durable quality as well! Even the apple certified/apple cords will eventually begin to split & fray near the prong base but not these!! Shipper/merchant was excellent as the product was delivered quickly and in hassle free pkging!
It's been great having extra cables around to charge my Apple products
I figured I wouldn't scrape the barrel for the cheapest lightning cable I found and I also wouldn't confetti my money by buying Apple's product
 I like saving $$, but in this case I have decided the Apple product is the one to get
  This cable is not certified and the iPhone lets you know that when you plug it in
Can never have enough cables to charge all our Apple electronics!!
  The cables seem to be bigger in diameter than the standard Apple cords which I am glad of
  It seems my wife and I have had several Apple cords split right behind USB plug where there is a larger insulator wrap, the split happens right at the stress point (going from big to smaller diameter)
Just as good as Apple branded cords for quite a bit less $
 The lightning plug size is the same as Apple's as well, so they should fit easily into any case
Cables have worked great on my iPhones and iPads for power and data
  Will definitely buy more as the quality appears to match/exceed Apple for half the cost
  This is the real deal for 3rd party chargers
cheaper than apple cable, works perfectly
Bought before a trip as I couldn't find my original Apple cord
Works and feels just like an Apple lightning cable but cheaper
These work exactly like Apple cables, thankfully, so tired of the knock off cheapies that throw error messages and don't charge reliably
While the cable didn't work when plug in my Win 7 laptop (my iPhone 5S didn't recognize the cable as an official Apple accessory), the cable works reasonably well with the USB wall power adapter
&#34;The construction quality is solid and comparable to (but less polished than) the official Apple product
 Lightning end about the same size as OEM Apple
 Strain relief on lightning end same size as Apple OEM
Legit - have worked perfectly with AC adapter and usb port on laptop
If these cords ever arrive, I hope they'll be compatible with whatever iPod i may own in the future
Both single and double packages come individually wrapped and sealed so confident product is original and meets OEM specs for Iphone 6 needsCable end that plugs into phone can be inserted face up or bottom up (with logo showing or not) so very easy to plug in and remove cable from phone
 I've bought other brand including amazon brand but it was little wider at the end and didn't fit my iPhone w the new case over it
(otter box preserver) this one shape exactly like apple brand and fit my iPhone and iPad mini no problem though the case charging opening
  As long as they can charge my iPhone and iPad, I'm good with these minor differences
Equivalent quality to Apple cords at 1/2 the price
Item states that it is Apple certified, but it only lasted a  month so was not worth the money!
these are cheaper and have lasted longer than the apple cords
These iphone 6 charging cables work great
Amazing quality and comes with two AND still cheaper than one from Apple
  They are the perfect length and actually seem more sturdy than the cords that come directly with the Apple products
  Appear to be well-made as opposed to some inexpensive Apple knock-offs
I tried to go cheap on Apple stuff and these are the best quality aftermarket lightning cables I have found BUT, they are not anywhere near the quality and durability of the Apple cables
  Fire hazard for a few more $ over Apple?  No way
Does not work,  i know apple products are expensive but they are worth it
 Id say its on par with apple OEM cables
 I bought it for my Aunt as a replacement for her original apple cord
 Does not feel as good as the original from Apple, but they perform just as well
  The end that plugs into the iphone is about the same size as the apple one, so there shouldn't be any issues with using cases
Great product, does what it should, works great!  I've been looking for a lightening cable that's inexpensive that works as good or better than Apple's
  This product is not as thick of a cord as the iXCC 10ft
  If you are searching for a Apple certified lightening replacement or spare?  I highly recommend the iXCC
Work great, and these are a lot cheaper than an actual Apple cord
These work every bit as good as the Apple cables
Just like the apple cords
  The 8 pin adapter fits perfectly, just like the OEM version
These work very well, no difference between these and Apples cord
Works well with apple products, and no annoying popups!(and much better priced than Apple OEM! )Decent quality, won't pull apart within a week unless abused; overall a good cable for the price
 I like the way the plug fits securely into the iPad
The lightning connector size is not the same size as in the pictures and therefore won't fit many iphone cases
 The image shows the narrow style (like Apple's) but is actually the wider style many third party manufacturers are selling
I purchased 6 of these chargers because the apple brand chargers fail so frequently (imagine the shock when I go to the Apple Genius Bar to tell them every lightning cable I ever bought failed within a couple of months)
Solid construction quality, and it fits within the port allowed by a Lifeproof case
Good quality cables, albeit a bit thicker and stiffer than OEM Apple ones
The problem is that the the end connector IS in fact larger than the OEM Apple, so you may have problems fitting certain cases
  It does fit the LifeProof Fr&eacute; case but NOT the Otterbox PreserverDimensions:OEM Apple Lightning dimension (end plug) 7
 Also the connections are as thin as apples, not like Amazon's version, which I own as well
 Having them thick at the end does not allow it to connect to your iphone with certain cases, if not all
Great cables! Work with new apple iPhones and they updateS!
Finally a good priced lightning cable that works on my apple products consistently
  I've never had this issue with my OEM Apple Lightning Cable so, while this is a minor annoyance it definitely isn't a deal breaker
Regarding construction, these are of lower quality than OEM cables (thinner wire, slightly cheaper plastic housings) but you can get two functional cables for the price of a single Apple OEM 3ft
  Since one is going in my Jeep and the other is staying in the office, I'd prefer cables that are somewhat &#34;disposable&#34; due to the likelihood of wear and tear; it will be cheaper to continue to replace cables at this pricepoint than to risk a more expensive and only moderately better Apple product
These cables work good and are compatible with iphone 5's
 Wish it were longer but apple cable is same length
  They are the same length as the standard Apple cord
 6 months I believe is a reasonable amount of time, since the apple one only runs about 9 months for 3x the price
 My whole family has iPhone 5s, so extra cables come in handy
 These work just like the ones you buy at the Apple Store
  Apple should be embarrassed at the prices they charge for the cables at their store
These cables work great!  Much more durable than the OEM ones that come with apple products
I have bought three sets of these after my apple cable failed
  It has a fairly small opening and many of the non-Apple cables are too bulky to do the job
  Time will tell if the longevity is better than Apple
  The OEM iPhone cable lasted 6 months
  For extra chargers, I think this is a great alternative if you think apple brand is too expensive
Inexpensive alternative to the Apple brand lightning cord and works just the same!
I didnt know what to think when I first purchased these, but they were much better of a price than the ones made by Apple
Despite being &#34;Apple Certified&#34; these cables don't work with MacBook Pro, iPhone 5, or current iPads
  I previously used IXCC cables for iPhone 4 and iPad 2 without problem
 But the Apple cords are very pricey, so I bought these after reading great reviews
2 cables that fit my fiance's iPhone with her case on
 cant tell the difference between this and the apple original
Charge well and are sturdier than the standard iphone chargers
  So, we decided to purchase some actual MFI (Made For iPod; Apple's method of approving accessories) cables and found these
  I will use this brand as long as I use apple products!
  They are about the same in quality as the apple cables
We spend hundreds on a phone, why not spend a little $ and get an item that will last and do the job?  That being said, it is quite $ for simple cables, which is why I only gave it 4 stars
Works well and significantly cheaper than apple brand
I bought these lightning cables because they are certified and they work with a lifeproof case from the reviews that I read
 Comparing to the factory apple cable it is hard to tell a difference in size
 Great price for quality cables!UPDATE:After buying an iPhone 6 I recently purchased a lifeproof case for it
 Specifically the Lifeproof iPhone 6 Nuud Case
The claim the these are certified Apple Lightning Cables is half false
When trying to charge with the white cable, I was given an error message on my phone, leading me to suspect only the black cable was Apple Certified [what a scam that we must now all have Apple Certified products, anyways I digress]
 The last cable even broke the charging circuitry on my iPhone, I was about to walk into to the Apple store and succumb to Apple charging $20 for a new cable when I stumbled upon these
 It's ridiculous that two cables cost $17 (2 micro USB cost about $9--[[ASIN:B00C28L6EW AmazonBasics USB Cable - 2
9 Meters), 2 Pack]]), but that's the price you pay for buying into the Apple cult
 There's no legitimate reason that flimsy little cables should cost this much except for Apple's proprietary pettiness and greed
 The reason I only gave four rather than five stars is because $17 for two plain cables is a terrible value, but that's more on Apple than iXCC
These cordS have a Perfect fit and function just like the original Apple equipment for a fraction of the price
You're basically getting two Apple certified 8 pin cables for under the price of one actual Apple 8 pin cord
 The thing that I like the most about them is that the lightning connector that goes into the phone is the same size as the original that came with my iPhone 5s
PRO:* Cheap* MFI compliant (which means, apple approves them so no pesky messages)* Good qualityCON:* NoneCONCLUSIONHighly recommended
 Exact fit as Apple cable
 The connector is genuine apple, and fits my lifeproof case just fine
 Most non apple certified plugs have to be trimmed to fit
 Cable insulation seems better quality that OEM apple, hopefully will last longer than 6 months, like all the rest of my apple ones
  One important thing to note is that the Lightning end is at least as small as the original Apple cable so it fits into just about any case
  You get 2 cables for less then the price of one apple cable
Excellent and inexpensive alternative to the Apple lightning cable
This iXCC lightning cable is Apple MFi licensed/certified, what this means is that it has been manufactured to meet Appleâs standards and requirements
The cable is virtually identical to the one Apple includes with their devices, the lightning plug is of the same size as Appleâs unlike for example the Amazon Basics Lightning cable which is also MFi certified but has a wider plug than this iXCC cable
The construction of the metal part of the lightning plug itself is also identical to the one made by Apple
 (See photo comparison)Iâve tested the iXCC cable with my MacBook and all the chargers I have at home and it works without any issues for both charging and syncing with my iPhone 5s, iPhone 5 and iPad Air
For $17 you are getting two apple-certified lightning cords, they work perfectly with my iPhone 5, thats way better than buying an apple one for $20
