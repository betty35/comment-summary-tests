I've bought a total of 3 of these cables I've had the first for over a month and works great
This cable works lightening-fast
 No need to wiggle the cable around the port to get it to fit properly or for the device to pick it up
 The cable also stays straight, i
Quality is ok, but the cables tend to fray around the connection end fairly quickly
  I have used a different &#34;cheaper&#34; brand before but you'll soon receive the error that the cable is not the right one for this accessory
Got the cables using prime so I got them in 2 days
hard to find Lightning cables that work for a long time
Honestly, these are the only charging cables I've had that have not frayed or stopped working after a short period of time
Our family has 3 iPhone 6 phones, and I now have 4 of these cords as extras
1 cord didn't even work when we got it, the other stopped working already
Only sent me one wire when I purchased 2
Cables work great! No issues
 cable is very convenient and it feels like a high quality cable
What can you say?  It's a cable
Work perfectly and are more durable than other cables I have used
Excellent Cables, they work just as described and have been great!
These cords are great!
Cables are holding up very well
 The cable has been with me everywhere I go
Great cables! Top-notch quality and they work with every case I have tried so far
Haven't had any problems with these cables at all
fits ALL CASES, may be narrower than OEM cable
I bought four of these cables to have around the house
Received in the beginning of May, and used these cables constantly with no problem
Cables work just like OEM and delivery was quick
One cord stopped working with in a week, very dissapointed with quality
After one use the cables no longer work
So far so good on the Lightning Cable
This lasted longer than the other cables I've bought! Highly recommended!
  Dont waste your money on the cheap wires
ONE OF CABLES DID NOT WORK OUT OF THE BOX
These cords are great
 I have ruined more than one cord there and after a month or so of daily use they do not show any noticeable wear and tear
No problems with these chargers
 One of the cables cover is splitting and the wires are exposed
Great cables at a great price compared to others, and they work!
  They look exactly like the original cables that came with my purchases
  Can't beat the price for cables of this quality that don't throw up errors
 My cables started having issues about after 9 months from wear & tear
 They gave me a prepaid label to return the old cable and sent me the replacement very quickly!
I have bought several different lightning cables from Amazon and only half the time they work but this is the second time I bought this brand-new and it's worked every time
 Replace 2 cords which had stopped working consistanty
2 of the 4 cables I bought burned out within about a week of use
I gave a 3 star rating because the cables still working, work well
  This is the cord only - no wall plug
 Would recommend if you need a short cable that performs as advertised
 Tried multiple outlets and bases to eliminate any other factors
 I have issues with some cords burning out or fraying and that has not happened to this cord
 It looks just like other lightening cables
 Had no issues with the cables
Came in on time and the cable is working well!
good cords heavy duty
I have bought many ipod and lightning cables over the years
Works great second time buying replacement of old original wires and first ones still work great
  Purchase charging cables from another supplier
Work much better than cheaper or even more expensive cables
The lightning connector works very well
Cables work great and are holding up well - now if the kids would quit losing them so I wouldn't have to buy anymore
Two cords one package
This cord died after less than 4 months
 Not sure how to use the warranty for a hopeful replacement, although it wasn't a long term quality cord
I bought these to replace an inferior off-brand set of lightning cables I got off eBay, with braided fabric cords in three lengths
Got this cable a while ago but haven't used it heavily yet
 It's moderately priced compared to other cables, so didn't expect it to break intermittently like this
 Moreover, look and feel of the cable is good but not as great as other cables such as Amazon or Chromo
It does not have the IXCC stamp, like on my previous cable from a different seller, so I was skeptical but the two I received work fine
Fast processing and great cables
  These cables from iXCC work perfectly and I am thrilled with them
 Do not buy other cheap brand cables I have made that mistake in the past
One of the cords broke  within days of use
So far these cords have worked great
The cables which I recieved were packaged very nicely
These aftermarket Lightning Cables are great! I bought both the 3 foot and 6 foot cables
 I later bought the 6 foot cables and was a little disappointed that the longer cables were not the same construction
 The connecters are a little bulkier on the longer cables and the cable is thicker and stiffer
 Cords work great, the block I was using to plug into was terrible
 Not the cords fault
 In hindsight, I might have considered the longer cables
 Haven't had any problems, but I baby & protect my cables
 Had these cables for a month with no problems
  They are definitely not the cheap no name cables where it is hit or miss
 One cable works very well in my car and hasn't failed me as long as I've had it
 The second cable, on the other hand, gave me  &#34;accessory is not supported&#34; messages and would not charge, straight out of the package! Very disappointing
Cables work very well
 My children are very hard on these cords and have broken others in just days
 We have 6 products which use these cords
Awesome, authentic cable for half the price
  Had ordered other cords, but they would work now and then
I bought the package of 2 cables
 It looks brand new, no visual damage to cord or exposed wires
As soon as I started using this cord, I realized how much more durable it is compared to the cheap knock off cords
  A few weeks in, and I've had no issues with the cables, and they work as advertised
within 2 weeks the cable had frayed at the connecting ends
This is an alright deal for 2 cables
 The cords are great
 The cords also bend and fold easily unlike some thicker, bulkier cords on the market which means they are great for folding into glove boxes and keeping this tidy
  Both cables charges well
Unlike a much earlier order of supposedly &#34;certified&#34; iXCC Lightning cables, these newer versions (iXCC is printed on both ends on the new ones) work great and seem to be lasting well
These cables are working fine
 It will cost me more money to send them than buying new cable from some where else
 Most people should know by now that the Lightning Cable has huge design flaw
These are short standard cords! Although that may be obvious to some, they were one of the first results that showed up when I typed in &#34;6ft
After spending a lot of money on cheap cables, we finally decided to spend a little extra and it has been very worthwhile
 These cables are as good as the ones we got with our devices
One of these corded worked great, the other didn't work at all
 I bought a second set as our daughter just got a phone and I like to have extra cables for the car and downstairs
I got a white and black cables a few months ago and both still work great
The cable looked like it's of good quality compared to the old ones that I bought
Tough, nice quality cables
These cables are super solid for being so tiny
 This cable handles both
I bought a two pack from this company and when I got the cords
One of the cords I kept in my office at work and rarely used has already stopped working
Great and much cheaper alternative lightning cables! Don't hesitate to buy these!
Love these chargers! Designed to last!
The cables work as expected
  This cable seems a lot more sturdy in that area
Excellent! I have used them for more than one year and they didn't cause any problem for me! So I purchased extra few cables for my travelling package! They are really good!
Both cables are of very fine quality
  These are NOT your generic $2 cables
  My girlfriend buys the cheap $10 ones from Dollar General and other junk stores, and then complains that they don't last (they're the same junk cables you one can find on Amazon for $2-$5)
These lightning cables work perfect going on 3 months no problems at all
  The iXCC cables seem well made and the plugs are on the smaller side so they should fit in most cases
  I also purchased a few Omaker branded lightning cables from amazon which were also made and sold by this same iXCC company and also claimed to be MFI certified
  All the Omaker cables no longer work because I get a compatibility error
  I'm hoping these iXCC cables don't go down the same path as the Omaker junk
Only one of the cables worked
Bought the 2 pack and only 1 cable worked
The cables work well and for a great price
The black cable still works fine, but I'm extra careful since the incident with the white one
  I bought this cord in FEB 2015
  I have 3 of these cords
Great chargers only brand I buy
 I've been using these cables for over a week now and they seem to work great like the original cable!
Bought 2x 2packs so a total of 4 cables
 Oddly enough though, I bought 2 of the 10ft versions of these cables and they both work great
 Maybe there's some issue with these smaller 3ft cords
  Having to bundle up and transport cables several times per day is irritating
  Found inexpensive reliable cables to leave in place
Great cables for my gadgets!
2 charger cables for $17? It makes you wonder at first, all of the awesome reviews speak for the cables
 So far these cords work great on all the devices
 Will buy again if/when we need additional cords
Still works unlike some other cheaper cables that died after a month of use
Bought 3 sets, have lasted 2 teenagers and a hectic husband who uses it in the car, office, upstairs, etcetera and outlived the original cables that tend to break after 3 months
Cables work just like the official ones for almost half the price
These cables lasted about 6 months with no problem
 I prefer these cables over the manufactured one that comes with my device
These ixcc cables work perfectly
6 ft cords have become frayed and broken
 Not sure if it was durability issue or just the way my family uses them, as I've had the same thing happen with Amazon and other 6 ft cables I've purchased
For the money this cable can't be best
Cables work great and love that they come in black and white so I can distinguish them from all of my crappy cords
  These cables seem better than the less expensive ones I have bought in the past that did not hold up for more than 6-8 months
  Use these over my apply USB cables
 We like to be able to charge at work and in the car if we have to and we don't want to have to unhook and haul the cables with us so we were in need of 4 extra cables
 These cables were about the least expensive so I thought I'd give it a try
Cables work great - no issues just like the apple cables
 A few months later my remaining OEM cables started to fail I ordered again because the price is right
Unfortunately, this time around, one of the two cable came dead on arrival
Cords don't have an easy time at our house and once these go you're pretty much screwed
 I bought the product and both of the cords stoped working after 1 week the white and 1 month th black
 Wiring meeds to be more thick
Very solid feeling cable
 Had it for about a month now and the cable looks like the day I bought it
Had these cords for 2 months now and haven't had any problems
works great for awhile, especially love the black colored cable
  Now I won't be confused as to whose cable is mine
Not durable, I have purchased several cables now and they do not last as long as the other brands I have used
 Started using it as soon as I received (couple days) and both cords worked perfectly with no issues, however, the black cord broke off at the lightening connector
 The white cord is still working fine
  All the cables are fine
So far, I have enjoyed having these spare cables very much
  Other generic cables I've picked up have caused the incompatibility warning to pop up on my phone and soon would not work reliably, but these have never given me trouble
Great little cables! I have them in my car and my room
 Really disappoint with this cable
However they seem like they would be durable cords, 4 months later this cord just stopped working
I needed extra cables and these have been great!
 Cord babied for the most part with no external damage visible
 At least the plug fit the case so it works on the snug cutouts
This is a decent cable for the cost
Have worked great for several months now, highly recommended as extra charging/syncing cable
One cable stopped working after 5 months
Bought these cords (2)  a few months ago and they are already shorting out
Don't hesitate at all when buying these cords
 You won't waste your money with these charging cords!
Cables have worked reliably over the last couple of months without any complaints from the &#34;iDevice's&#34;
  Do not buy the 10 ft version as it does not fit (I am stuck with a 10 ft cable)
Extra cords are very handy! These came on time and just as described
 I will buy these the next time one of my kids breaks, or loses their cord
These really are superior cables
  I am so \\"done\\" with cheap cables that quit working days after you buy them
Way better than any other third-party Lightning cable I've ever bought (and thrown away)
 If I need more cables definitely I will buy these cable again!
Both cords have already stopped working
Just like the OEM cable
These cables have worked flawlessly since I purchased them, I have had several other cables go bad but these from iXCC have been great
Great cables, have been going strong for 5 months now
the cables work just fine and are of excellent quality
This is a good cord
 It hasn't started fraying in the end yet as the original cord did
 I've owned these cords for about 6 months
 They are decent quality cables and I haven't had any charge or sync issues with them
We had one cable where the lightning end broke off
Bought these cables around 6 months ago and they are still working
 I would recommend them if you need new cables
Cable worked as advertised, thanks!
Everything exactly as stated, cables were correct and worked
Great cables at a great price
I first bought these Lightning cables 6 months ago, I wasn't sure of the quality but I need to replace the cables that came from Apple as they were broken
  So far the cable have worked flawlessly
  Just last week I needed to replace a couple more of the original apple cable so I ordered a second set and they are working fine
  I will be ordering more of these cable soon too
I've had this for about a month now, using the cables both in my car and at home
  They are thicker than other cables and the plug seems more solid and larger than typical lightning plugs
Good cable for the price
The cables work perfectly
I purchased these cables to leave at work and in my handbag so I would always be ready to recharge
 We now have the cables we need to charge everything and they work flawlessly
In fact, because of my experience with these cables I have since bought additional iXCC products
The quality of these cables is excellent
The cables worked great and the charged the phone fast not like other third party cables
  Both of these cables have lasted me several months already with no issues
 The price is lower, and I have had no issues with these cables
These folks make really nice cables
 It would be nice however if they offered an 18&#34; cable
Received one black & one white cable
These are the smallest diameter cables I have found
 Great for the price, but it doesn't feel as sturdy as a true Apple-made lightning cable
 Still good for the price and it'll last if you're nice to the cable
  I also really like the black cable for my car so it doesn't stand out as much
  The cable is fine, no reason to spam your customers
 I have no complaints of any kind about this cable
 I'm very happy with these cables
 Also the white cable now turned yellow, I am assuming from the current that goes through it
 I am not a difficult customer, but the cable has become almost unusable
 It was much harder to find a decent 30 pin cable that didn't fall apart in the first week
 I definitely recommend this one, however, it would be nice if they made a 6 foot cable
Cables work fine! They have lasted pretty long so far
ordered two of these cables, one of them died after 3 days of use
 I wouldn't hesitate to purchase these cables again
This has been one of the sturdiest lightning cables I have tried
 The cable is a little bit thicker
 3 feet may be too short to be comfortable by your bed, but these are great for the multitude of other places you need a cord
The cable has a good structure and a solid piece of equipment
 They are not the sturdiest cables out there, so be careful when bending the cable around the ports
Great substitute for the expensive first-party cable
  I highly recommend this cable over shelling out the big bucks for bigger brand names
Same form-factor as Apple-branded cable, so it's not bulky
I've been using both cords pretty regularly (one at work, one in the car) and so far so good! I previously ordered the amazon brand cords but the cord part separated from the lightning end pretty quickly and so far these have fared better
Best cheap wires I could find, and so slim and compact
 I didn't want to waste more money on a cable that would only last a short time and stop being recognized by the device
After reading some reviews for these cables, I felt confident in purchasing them and having them live up to my expectations
These cables work just as expected
Have had problems with other lightning cables
 So far all four of the cables are working as advertised
If any of them fail like other lightning cables I have bought in the past, I will update my rating
Cables seem to perform well, but are a little stiff
  I'm able to have cords everywhere so I'm not taking my bedroom one out everyday
Having one cable for home and another one for my vehicle/travel is what I have been using them for
The iXCC cables have worked great so far
 I have not experienced any of the issues that others have reported with different third party lightning cables
 Overall, the cables work like they should and I am pleased with the purchase
Good cable at a good price
One cable was bad upon arrival
unfortunately both cables did not work
  Used daily for 3 months so far, and the cables show no signs of wear at all
the cables are everything I expected and hoped them to be
 I use the cables regularly and I have not had a problem with any of them
So I have had these cables for a couple months and have had no problems with them
 Never can have too many charger cables
Very satisfied with these cables
 They fit perfectly unlike some of the cheaper cables
 I have been using this for the past few months and feel that the quality is on par with the genuine lightning cable
love it, I have not had any issues with these cables
These cords are frustrating
Works great! The customer service is the BEST part of buying these cables
 I was then sent a replacement cable in no time
Tried the cheaper cables which only lasted a few weeks, then switched to these which are much more durable and hold up to travel which means they are constantly being unplugged and packed away
I am always leery of non OEM cables but so far these are all still going strong
 Good deal to split with a friend since it has two cables!
I bought the 2-pack of these lightening cables 4 months ago and was delighted with their performance
 Recently, one of the cables stopped working
 The other cable from the 2-pack is still working, but I'll be replacing the defective one with another brand
 The orignal content was \\"Great cable at a great price: This is a quality charging cable
 The lightening connector has a low profile
 The cord is flexible and doesn't seem like it will kink up
 We went through a few more expensive cords and also tried cheaper $5 versions and they were constantly breaking
 I am now considering buying another set of these cords as stocking stuffers for my girls!
I have had limited success with aftermarket lightning cords but these have been great so far
The cables work perfectly well
 The cables are sturdy and well built
 The certified cables are any day better than the non-certified ones
 I definitely recommend these cables
 Apparently the cable I got was not as certified as the description and title said
 I use the black one in my car (which matches my other adapters) and I use the white one at my PC
 In my case, I did not get the iXCC logos on my cables (no problem) and the metal tips of the connectors are not one piece (contrary to reports by some others)
 See photo, which also shows the 2-piece tip design (indicated by seam around the perimeter of the connector)
Bought these cables as a backup wire for my car and my job
 These cords hold up better than the cheap ones you see selling for fifty cents from overseas
  The iXCC cords seem to be more durable so I am going to try them out to see if they last longer
The smaller cables work well (I bought some longer ones which kink something terrible)
Great cords for a good price
  Work on wall plugs, portable chargers, and computer USB's
  Stop the search here for inexpensive third party cables bc many others will turn out being cheap and often hit or miss
I bought a 3 pack of 6' charging cords and 2 quit working within a week of buying them but the 3rd one is still going strong after 3 months
Update 1/15/15  Contacted IXCC and they stand behind their products and replaced the defective cords free of charge
 Another reviewer suggested cutting the cable and throwing it in the trash
 In my opinion, and I apologize for having the most basic electronic engineering knowledge, cutting the cable and discarding it will in fact make it work much much worse and you will probably void the warrantee thus making the situation worse by wasting your money
 Black cord didn't work right out of the box
 White cord broke the first time I used it
 I was willing to accept it taking a month and the first cord not working but nothing worked and it took a month waiting for a terrible product
Ordered a set of 2 iphone cables
These are very cheap cables that break (literally fall apart) after about 30 uses
excellent cable so far
Received the package, very cheap cable in a very cheap plastic bag, no label, no printing on the cable,  neither manufacture name
UPDATE: 03/24/2015The cable finally died today
) At least I still have a second cable for emergency use
Sturdiest charger cables that I have purchased in some time
 Cable diameter seems just a tad bit smaller diameter but barely
 Definitely would recommend these cables as replacements
Cables work great and charge quickly
 Cable is also sturdy at both ends with solid ends to help protect ends from breaking or wire at ends from splitting
after purchasing the single white cord and worked great w ixcc connector , i bought this set so i have one upstairs and one for my car
The cord is great
 This cord does what it's supposed to do and is sturdy
These lightning cables seem to be of good quality, and I haven't had any problems with them
  They are not as soft and pliable as OEM cables, but they are also much cheaper
They work never have gotten any pop ups say it doesn't work or anything really one of the best cables you can buy and for the price it can't be bet
 Nice to have a reasonably priced lightning cable that does not give the connection errors like the uncertified cables
These cables are the real deal
especially since I don't get that 'lovely' message about the cords not being compatible ;)
These cables were one of the best I had
Great cable for a super price! Fast shipping
These have lasted longer than the Amazon Brand cables which fall apart after 6 months
good cables for the price, last about 3-4 months
This is a CERTIFIED cable, I'm very happy about this purchase
  Within a few weeks, two of them started to come apart at the lightning connector/cable sleeve and I could see the metal shielding mesh but the cable still worked
  I am not hard on my cables so I am not sure how this happened
  All four are in the trash and I went to Apple and pony-ed up for two new Apple cables
The cable stopped working 2 days after I received it
Neither cord works will be returning
Much better than the cheap knock off cables
So I decided on buying these iXCC cables and it was totally WORTH IT
 It just works completely like the original cord without the original price
 The build quality is good and I have never seen any breakdown of the cord from the constant unplugging after six months
 So this cord is GREAT!I highly recommend this cable for your lightning port needs
So far these cords are great
Nice to have 2 lightning cables
 I will reverse this comment if I am reimbursed for both cords
These work just fine as replacement cables
 Plug is snug in phone and is good quality
 Good price for two cables
Two cables for $16
Theses cables work with nor issues
I wanted to avoid the cheap charging cords with poor reviews so these were the next best choice
I tested out both cables, and both worked perfectly
Great value cords work perfectly
No connection problems with these cables, and having both black and white options is useful
They're both still working great, and the cords look nice and don't tangle up
 I'm not too tough on my cords, so I can't speak to durability, but I think they're a great purchase
finally cables that work!
These work OK, but the black cable broke within a month of use
Finally found a 3rd party cable that works and doesn't give the 'this product can't work with this device' nonsense!
I have bought 2 different cords previously and these are the only ones that are still working
  The seller did replace the cable and currently I have two working but I must question the quality of their product
I bought the 2-pack of 3ft cables, one in white and one in black
 Paying $17 for the pair, I would have been better off buying a better brand for one cable, or trying my luck with a 3 or 4 pack for cheaper (I did the latter
I've purchased many of the inferior non-certified cables and all of them have failed
 Don't waste your time or money on those cables
 These cables are excellent and the best value out there
BTW, the only one that has lasted over 6 months is the Amazon Basic 3 ft lightning cable I bought soon after the lightning cables were introduced
Good luck to others who are thinking of buying this cable
  Strain relief at both ends appears to be good quality and molded into the plastic adapters
  No puckering or shrinking of the covering, and the end adapters appear to be very good quality
7 mmIXCC Cable dimension (end plug) 10
0 mm-Update on 4/14/15 - one of the two cables I purchased broke off at the Lightning adapter end about a week ago
 Great quality, work just like OEM cables
I bough the package that came with one black and one white cord
 Interesting because I saw another review that had the same problem with the black cord
I only tried using the black cord twice and of course the second time it was after the return eligible period
The white cable initially showed as a non-compatible accessory; unplugging and replugging didn't help at all
  The cables do not pop up the annoying message about not being compatible
I have gone through so many lightning cables that have either worked for a week or two at the most and then die or don't work from the start
 I was worried about buying another off brand cable, but I gave them a chance
Very good presentation, I hope doesn't fail the cables! Quick shipping
After purchasing several cables online
  The lightning end fits my Candyshell case without any problems
  This cable is still working after a month of abuse
 The cords that I received from this order perform just like an Apple cord
Great back up cords!
Connector out from wires in 2 weeks
works great, I definitely recommend to buy this lightning cable
Both of my cords work perfectly
  Bought Apple-branded cables and threw these out
I've gotten cheaper knock-off cords, and they typically last all of about a week
  My only gripe is the cables themselves are a little flimsy, but not so much to be a major concern (and what can you expect at the price?)
 To be fair the black cord works fine
 One cord only works in one direction though
Bought these because they had a good review  The connection that plugs into phone has not broke yet
Since I purchased these cables to charge my phone, I returned them for a full refund without any hassle
  You can definitely find cheaper lightning cables out there
  So far both of these cables are working EXACTLY as they're supposed to
We bought some &#34;cheapo&#34; iPhone 5 cables off Amazon awhile back, just so we could each have a cable at home, work, and car
  Well, after a few months of use, the cheap cables stopped working--we kept getting the error which indicated the cables are &#34;not approved for use with this device&#34; (can't recall the exact wording)
I've had these cables for almost 2 weeks now
  The most important part is the durability of these cables, and as far as I can tell, they look like they will hold up fine
99 cables from an online auction site, and while they work fine initially, they don't last very long
 I decided to buy another one of these cables because the first one worked so well
 Instead of the 3 ft I purchased the 6 ft cable
 For some reason the 6 ft cable lightening connection is much larger than the previous 3 ft cable I purchased
 I have attached photos to show the differences in the cables
These iXCC MFI cables work well, and have lasted through several updates
 Plus you get two for the price of one Apple-branded cable
 Still, I love my phone and this is the best cabling solution I could find
 These cables seem to be good quality and decent strength, and I haven't had any problems with them
I have not had any issues with these cables
 So if you have a case with a small opening for the lightning connector (which I do), then the only cables that will work are ones with the same size connector as the OEM cable
 It is annoying to order a cable and have it not fit because it has too large of a connector to fit your case
 They are a great OEM-comparable cable
You can never have enough Lightning cables, the trick is finding economic cables of sufficient quality
The cables has reached my expectations and a bit more
 I had bought the two cable combo and tried them both out
My daughter's worn out cable needed replacing
 I purchased this set so that she would have a replacement cable and so we could keep a cable in our vehicle too
 Both cables work and seem to be of decent quality
 If these cables hold up well, we will be purchasing another pair
Great cable and works well
 I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to save money and for a quality cable
These cables are great
Works like the normal ones so far! It's great for the price since these cords are so easy to lose!
  This cable work really good, like a original
  No such problems with these cables and I am highly satisfied
Bought the two pack so that I could have a cable at work and in the car
 no need to spend much more on any other cables
Great quality non-apple lightning cables
 I'm gonna order another set of the 3' cables and the 10' cables
 The Amazon brand cable I bought last winter is still working but showing wear and tear after two months of use
 After careful reading of product reviews, I decided to purchase this IXCC cable
 It did not disappoint me! Hopefully it continues to work and I'll definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for a good quality lightening cable to be used on a daily basis
These little old wires seem to work just fine
 Buy these wires and you'll be okay
One of the cables worked and the other did not
 None certified cables are usually poorly made have or develop syncing/charging issues, produce other errors
 The wider plug can cause issues with cases since the opening in the case might be too small for the wider plug
 This iXCC cable will work with all cases
 While lesser quality lighting cable have metal plugs made out of separate metal components that are then fused to make the plug the IXCC cable is made out of one metal element without seams or gaps
