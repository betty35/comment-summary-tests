best in any headphones ~ $100)  + Price (~ $90)  + Good gaming headphone  - Soundleak (being an open headphone it will leak sound so the person sitting next to u can listen to the music u r hearing,

of it', 'AD700 is that good but u need a quiet place to listen to it) M50 (Closed Headphone)  + Neutral sound (as meant for studio headphones)  + Bass  + Price (for $100 this is a steal)  + Build quality (better than mdr-v6, especially the stock earpads)  + Portable  - Comfort (Fits tight to ear like all closed headphones)  - Lacks soundstage (better than V6 but not as good as AD700) I liked

of these right out of the box, but after about 10 hours of burn in the bass started opening up more, and at about 20-30 hours the treble started getting smoother', 'Good bass, but not overpowering, great clarity', 'The bass is clear and true', 'And people are right, I can understand the muffled muddy exaggerated bass after listening to these', 'I got this headphone for practicing & monitoring electric guitar, especially mixing effects pedals', 'Also mixing sounds on my electric guitar pedals using these headphones sound a lot closer to plugging into the PA', 'I own Shure SE110s and SE210s, but these ATH-M50s blow those out of the water', 'Although the Beats sound was great, the bass seemed a little over the top', 'The bass is astonishingly deep but can be a bit loose at times', '-The bass is incredible, especially with an adjustable EQ like on the Cowon', 'The instruments are clear and separated, the bass is deep and punchy, and the cans leak almost no sound', 'You can always boost your bass with an amp or EQ which I did with a few test tracks (Infected Mushroom, NIN, Morcheeba etc', 'But I kept the EQ level on some lossless acoustic Johnny Cash and a few other acoustic recordings and the detail is just amazing', 'first of all im all about sound', 'the bass hasnt really kicked in as much as people say', 'Bass is punchy, which is a word I heard a lot on reviews like this but didnt really know what it meant until I heard these', \"The bass just hits you, it's really nice\", 'The bass on those is all jacked up out of proportion, but my Audio Technicas came balanced perfectly', 'I might suggest buying the coiled chord, but other than that these are the way to go', 'No over loud bass super clean true representation of what is in the mix', 'The headphones literally dissect the entire song to separate instruments, you can clearly hear every single instrument there is', 'Same goods for the bass', 'The ATs are very musical `phones: they cover the whole audible spectrum (perhaps a slight drop in the upper bass) with seeming ease, transients are no problem and only the higher vocal register appears a bit brittle yet, but this will most likely iron out with extended use', 'The bass is extended and sharply defined with lots of punch', 'The bass that I was missing from the Bose was prominent in these', 'But the bass is there, it is present', 'Others were correct in characterizing the bass as \\\\\\\\\"punchy\\\\\\\\\"', 'I can tell if the bass is muddy (bass in Beats, to me, are considered overpowering and muddy), and these headphones do not have that muddiness', 'Bass is better, no question', 'After trying these, I tried the Beats at their demo stand and realized how muddy the spoken/sung words were', \"The bass was overpowering and the overall sound quality from both the solo's and studio's just didn't compare\", 'First, you need to decide if you are actually a musician, and will actually be using them for nothing but mixing', 'You want a versatile headphone that will give you great response when in the studio, and be smooth an enjoyable when just listening to Scofield or Taylor Swift, pick your poison', 'The bass is absolutely perfect', 'The bass is phenomenal and is clear and spot on with most songs, only have found a couple where it is a little slow', 'Since it is closed it is not airy at all but is amazing for vocals', \"If you don't like the flat output, you can finagle with your signal chain's EQ to achieve your desired sound\", 'You could tell that they were overly bass-y and were meant only as a pair of headphones for someone that listens only to dubstep or rap and wants only that harsh bass response', 'Not only does it have superb bass, but it also has a great overall sound', 'The bass, is no beats studio', \"instead of just being boomy and resonating, making all the other sounds fade and be distorted, the bass on the M50's is tight, punching, and DEFINITELY there\", 'the bass is outstanding and amazingly clear, yet not overpowering', \"I'm more of a clarity guy than a bass guy\", 'The bass is nice and punchy, and not overwhelming', 'They are very clear and the bass is punchy but not overwhelming for me', 'The bass is reproduced very well', 'A bit more about the bass -- I really would have to say try the headphone out for yourself, but the overall sound to me is very pleasant', '\\\\\\\\\" when I heard their bass clarity and extension', \"ATH-M50 are perfect for listening dance and other bass heavy music, they are good (not perfect) replacement for studio monitoring in late nights, when you don't wanna wake-up your neighbours and still need to hear that club sub basses\", 'Beautiful bass and smooth trebles', '(bass) Well astro knew that they did not want bass on their professional gaming headset because bass can cover up crucial sounds', ')  First thing I noticed about these headphones was that the bass is deep', \"And if you have ever heard a real cello playing in your living room, you'll know that the sound of the real thing can be full bodied & rich, with deeply satisfying bass resonance\", 'and blows them away in the bass', 'The natural bass is deep and clear, reproducing the chest thumping beats I love in swanky dance clubs', 'Like the other reviewers said, the bass on these is not overwhelming, but is very tight, clean and transparent', 'I even took these cans to some drumming sessions and was thoroughly impressed', 'Very \\\\\\\\\"rich\\\\\\\\\" sound overall, I don\\'t think think the response is as \\\\\\\\\"flat\\\\\\\\\" as my Senn HD-280s, but I\\'ll take the slight added warmth over the bass drop off the 280s have', 'The bass: its not overwhelming, perfect bass', 'If your a kinda person who likes booming skull shaking bass, these arent for you', 'But if you want crystal clear sound with really good bass']\n",
