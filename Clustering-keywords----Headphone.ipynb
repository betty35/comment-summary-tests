isolation', 'I personally used the pink noise method and it completely changed the sound quality', \"It is not wireless, and it is definitely not noise-canceling, but if you're in a quiet place and

can be heard by others around me', 'but I can say for sure that the sound is clear and crisp', \"Off the bat the sounds were flat like it's got no life or business being a full headphone but I've been burning the headphone w/white, pink noise from youtube for 24hr straight now and every time I check on it the sounds gets fuller and fuller\", 'These headphones definitely do what I wanted in terms of isolating outside noise, while faithfully reproducing the music I like', \"Don't expect total noise elimination,  you probably want active noise canceling for that; I like to hear some of the noise around me for situational awareness\", 'I must say that it is a bit tight on the head, but that is how it acts to cancel ambient sound', 'The sound is so clear its amazing', 'They do allow a lot of outside noise in at low volume', 'Noise isolation is also amazing', 'You can hear others talking when the volume is low', 'Even with the volume turned up decently loud they can not hear anything from them', 'The sound is clear and good', 'Only negative is some songs have a very narrow sound stage, it seems like the sound is right up on you, instead of spaced further away', \"As for sound stage,

cancelling headphones - just turn the volume up', 'Passive noise cancellation if music is loud enough', 'They started sounding funny and then one day, the sound was just gone', 'There is a static noise that appears at certain volumes with certain songs', 'They will get decently loud without a headphone amp but everyone around you will hear it to', 'Every single sound is clear and amazing',

well\", 'Cant imagine hearing better sound quality', 'Extended listening sessions will get pretty toasty', \") It doesn't overdo any frequency and every frequency is very much able to be heard with

something that was comfortable and blocked out most noise but had excellent sound and didn't require batteries\", 'Also, as with any new speakers do not, and I repeat, DO NOT use them at full volume the first few times', 'So now the only solution is listening ONLY high quality music :)With help of 3 way rotation sections, it will feet any head and block almost all noise', 'There is a little bit of residual noise in the room if the person wearing the headphones has them at a very high volume, but as I have yet to have heard of a pair of (casual) headphones that contain *all* of the noise at very high volumes, I count this a win', 'Noise isolation: These fit AROUND the ear very comfortably and cut out almost all background noise', 'You can only really notice noise when on pause or listening to quiet songs on medium volume', 'Sound: Great across all frequencies', 'They do not block out sound as well as some other headphones, but the sound is still excellent', \"They're also incredible for quiet, ambient music, because with the insane noise isolation, you'll hear the quiet things like never before\", 'They feel great and the sound is well-balanced', 'If I had one complaint, it would be the noise leakage from these', 'If you listen to your music loud, everyone around you will hear it crystal clear', \"The headphones needed some burn in but I'm now hearing things that I never heard before in sounds that I've been listening to for years\", 'I based this on the overall sound experience', \"But in those areas, they go above and beyond, and even though they're not noise cancelling, they do a pretty good job at keeping noise from distracting you\", 'It goes like this, Someone is talking and you hear them well, you put the Bose headphones on they sound a little less then before, then you turn noise cancellation on and then they sound more less and distant but you could hear them clearly', 'The sound is much better', 'Hearing sounds on songs I never heard with other (albeit lower quality) headphones', \"As a word of warning, these leak noise quite a bit, but then again, I prefer for my music to be very loud, so if you like a quieter volume, they most likely won't leak as much\", 'The soundstage (the \\\\\\\\\"air\\\\\\\\\" you can hear during a song) is slighty crowded when compared to open ear headphones, but you still feel as if

range without hurting the ears) all outside sounds are gone', 'Usually there is distortion on the bottom end, however, I have had no distortion with these headphones whether I am asking for difficult frequencies or, loud volume', 'That being said, the clamping force does help with a little bit of sound isolation, but not much', 'it makes me feel like im near speakers, not headphones', 'You really can hear everything the way it was meant to be heard', 'I also use them for field monitoring while shooting video, and they effectively block out enough ambient noise to do their job well', 'I suspect that noise canceling also blocks a good portion of the music', 'The  noise cancelling feature may  sell headphones  , but', 'not noise cancelling good but good', \"While you are in such a pain, I

know how the bows of the glasses [distance =or= reading glasses] can become uncomfortable primarily due to the two bows going under the ear cup of the headphones and thus producing additional pressure

without any audio mind you, simply take your hand with your thumb and index finger together, and slowly move up and down on the headphones cord [rub the cord with your fingers] where you should hear [if you have a good seal] a discernible rubbing sound as you do that in your LEFT ear where the cord comes out from that ear cup\", \"Proof: Try the same thing but purposely hold the left ear cup away from your left ear and that finger rubbing sound you're making with your fingers will disappear\", \"Crude, yes, and I agree forthwith, but it works =if only= to test for a good ear cup seal and thus,
